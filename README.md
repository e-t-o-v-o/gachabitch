# 🎰 GachaBitch: The REAL Gacha Experience 🌟

Welcome to GachaBitch, where we don't pretend climbing mountains is a personality trait! 🏔️ (Looking at you, Mihoyo 👀)

## 🚀 What is GatchaBitch?

GatchaBitch is a web-based gacha game that puts the "fun" in "fundamentally addictive gambling mechanics." Unlike *some* games that shall remain nameless (Like Genshin Impact), I don't bother with a half-baked story. I cut straight to the chase: pure, unadulterated gacha! Mostly because its a pain in the ass to make the rest and Claude got them rate limits.

### 🌈 Features That'll Make You Say "Wow, This Isn't Genshin!"

- **No Pity System**: Because life isn't fair, and neither am I! 😈
- **Characters That Don't Need 20GB of Voice Lines**: Our PNGs are mute, but they're honest about it.
- **A UI That Doesn't Require a PhD to Navigate**: You heard me.
- **Absolutely Zero Exploration**: No more pretending you enjoy climbing cliffs for hours!
- **Free Pulls That Are Actually Free**: No strings attached.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React**: Because I'm basic, but in a good way.
- **TypeScript**: For when JavaScript just isn't frustrating enough.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Because Claude told me so.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (or not, I dont care)
2. Run `npm install` (pray to RNGesus it works first try)
3. `npm start` and watch the magic happen
4. Profit

## 🐳 Why GachaBitch is Better Than Your Favorite Gacha

- **Not Genshin Impact**: No more pretending you care about the 500th NPC's backstory, and trying to excuse the fact that we still have stamina bars in games.
- **Not Star Rail**: Our lack of story is a feature, not a bug.
- **Not Honkai Impact 3rd**: Our menu doesn't require a user manual.
- **Almost Azur Lane**: But let's be real, nothing beats shipgirl waifus.
